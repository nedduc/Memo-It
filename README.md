# Memo-It - To do list, Work, Rest & Play

Gone to the fridge and wonder why your standing there, gone to the shops and come back with everything but the item you went in for. Our lives are getting busyier and busyier and sometimes you just need a little extra help. The difference with this little 'To Do List' is that it won't just be in one long list that you have to scroll down to find the item that needs to be done becasue it has been divided into three seperate pages, Work..Rest..&..Play. 

For all the important things you need to remember and do.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

In order for someone to access, I must deploy site to Github from Gitpod the container-based development platform I have been using: 
  - Make sure that I have "git added", "git commit -m" & "git push" to Github
  - Once in Github, I navigated to my sites repository - https://github.com/nedduc
  - Under my repository name, to the right of the screen click  Settings.
  - Under my repository name, to the right of the screen click Settings.
  - In the left sidebar, click Pages.
  - Under “GitHub Pages”, use the None or Branch drop-down menu and select a publishing source.
  - Optionally, use the drop-down menu to select a folder for my publishing source.
